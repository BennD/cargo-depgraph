# cargo-depgraph

Creates dependency graphs for cargo projects using `cargo metadata` and graphviz.

## Installation

`cargo install cargo-depgraph`

If you are using Arch Linux, you can alternatively install the AUR package `cargo-depgraph`.

## Usage

`cargo depgraph [options] | dot -Tpng > graph.png`

The full list of options can be seen by running

`cargo depgraph --help`

Commonly useful options:

* `--all-deps`

![cargo-depgraph's dependency graph](graph_all.png)

* `--all-deps --dedup-transitive-deps`

![cargo-depgraph's dependency graph with transitive dependency edges de-duplicated](graph_all_deduped.png)

## Output explanation

* square node = root / workspace member
* grey background = target-specific dependency
* dotted lines = optional dependency (could be removed by disabling a cargo feature)
* dashed lines = transitively optional dependency (could be removed by removing one of the dotted
  edges)
* line colors = dependency kinds w.r.t. root / workspace members
  * black = normal
  * blue = dev-dependency
  * green = build-dependency
  * light turquoise = build-dependency of a dev-dependency
  * dark green = both normal and build-dependency
  * violet = both dev-dependency and build-dependency
  * â€¦ not seen in the wild yet, but theoretically possible:
    * dark turquoise = both normal and build-dependency of a dev-dependency
    * pastel blue = both dev-dependency and build-dependency of a dev-dependency
  * red = you broke it
